# InfoVis-Assignment3

The goal of the final exercise is to choose the appropriate technique for a small data analysis example of your choice.

You can extend your data analysis by looking into additional aspects, such as the development of these socio-economic factors over time or the correlation with other factors. But you do not need to restrict yourself to the provided data. If there is other data you would like to analyze, take this opportunity to do so!

You can provide the analysis in the format of your choice (e.g., as interactive web site or notebook).

To get inspired, you can look at the [Hall of Fame 2020](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/InfoVis/HallOfFame/2020/index.html)!

Potential data sources:
* [Statistik Austria](https://www.statistik.at/web_de/statistiken/index.html)
* [Bundesministerium f√ºr Inneres](https://www.bmi.gv.at/412/Nationalratswahlen/)
* Twitter API

Some of you might be interested to analyze data with respect to the covid-19 outbreak. There are a lot of data sources available, for example:

* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) has a lot of [covid-19 datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=covid-19)
    [Information is Beautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) has a collection of [covid-19 related Google spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g_YxmDfQx7aOU2DKzNZo9b-NTk62Bju6X3z6OuCa6gw/edit#gid=515684451)
* [Daily data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data) used by [JHU CSSE dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)

The results of the analysis are presented by the groups at the end of the semester. As usual, we give out the best assignment award after this [presentation](https://tuwel.tuwien.ac.at/mod/assign/view.php?id=1091008)!

* What was the question / hypothesis before you started the analysis or which known fact did you plan to demonstrate?
* Which data was used for the analysis? Which preprocessing steps (e.g., imputing missing values, adjusting data formats etc.) were necessary?
* Which visualization method / interaction method did you choose and why?
* How was the visualization created / the prototype implemented?
* What are the answers to your initial question / can your hypothesis be confirmed visually?
